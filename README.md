# Meal Planner

This project is intended to automatically select meals for the week, create 
a shopping list and generate the recipies.

In order to make it work with ticktick you must install and follow the 
instructions at https://github.com/lazeroffmichael/ticktick-py.

You will need to have a file called .credentials in the root folder of the 
repository as well with this structure:
```yaml
client-id: <client-id>
client-secret: <client-secret>
username: <email>
password: <ticktick password>
```
